### 5.3 Steps to verify the WLAN Station BLE Power Save Example

#### 5.2.1 Steps to be followed to verify WLAN Station BLE Provisioning with Android **EFR Connect** App

1. Configure the Access point in OPEN/WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK mode to connect the SiWx91x in STA mode.
2. In Windows PC2 which is connected to AP through LAN, Download the Openssl package from above mentioned link and run SSL server by giving following command:  
Openssl.exe s_server -accept<SERVER_PORT> â€“cert <server_certificate_file_path> -key <server_key_file_path> -tls<tls_version>
Example: **openssl.exe s_server â€“accept 5001 â€“cert server-cert.pem -key server-key.pem â€“tls1**

   ![](resources/readme/output1.png)

3. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs BLE is in Advertising state and WLAN connects to Access Point and establishes SSL connectivity with SSL server opened on Windows PC1. Please refer the given below image for connection establishment at windows PC1,

   ![](resources/readme/output2.png)

4. Open a BLE scanner App in the Smartphone and do the Scan.

5. In the App, Silicon Labs module device will appear with the name configured in the macro RSI_BLE_APP_SIMPLE_CHAT (Ex: "WLAN_BLE_SIMPLE_CHAT") or sometimes observed as Silicon Labs device as internal name "SimpleBLEPeripheral".
6. Initiate BLE connection from the App.

7. After successful connection, LE scanner displays the supported services of Silicon Labs module.

8. Select the attribute service which is added RSI_BLE_NEW_SERVICE_UUID

(Ex: 0xAABB) and enable Notification for attribute UUID RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_2_UUID (Ex: 0x1BB1) to receive data sent by Wi-Fi STA.
9. Now from SSL server (windows PC1), send a message (Ex: "Hello from WiFi STA") to Silicon Labs device. Silicon Labs device forwards the received message from SSL server to remote BTLE device which is connected to Silicon Labs BTLE device over BTLE protocol. User can observe the message notification on attribute UUID RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_2_UUID (Ex: 0x1BB1) in BTLE scanner app.

   ![](resources/readme/ble_remote_device_output.png)

10. Now send a message (Ex: "Hello from bt slave") from GATT client (from smart phone BLE scanner app) using attribute RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_1_UUID (Ex: 0x1AA1) to Silicon Labs device. Silicon Labs device forwards the received message from BTLE remote device to SSL server over WiFi protocol. User can observe the message on UDP socket application.

11. After proper coex power save mode selection then power save command go to the module.

12. Note down power measurement by connecting Module to Agilent Power meter setup.
