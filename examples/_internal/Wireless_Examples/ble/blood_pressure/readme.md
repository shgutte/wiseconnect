### 5.3 Common Steps

**5.3.1** Server role

1. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module will be in Advertising state.
2. Open a nRFConnect App and do the scan. (see Figure 2)
3. In the App, Silicon Labs module will appear with the name configured in the macro `RSI_BLE_APP_BLOOD_PRESSURE` (Ex: "BLS") or sometimes observed as Silicon Labs device as internal name "SimpleBLEPeripheral".
4. Initiate connection from the App.
5. After successful connection, nRFConnect displays the supported services of Silicon Labs module.
6. Select the attribute service which is added `RSI_BLE_BLOOD_PRESSURE_SERVICE_UUID` (Ex: 0x1810). (see Figure 3 and 4)
7. Enable Notify for the characteristic `RSI_BLE_BLOOD_PRESSURE_MEASUREMENT_UUID` (Ex: 0x2A35). So that GATT server notifies when value updated in that particular attribute.
8. Silicon Labs module sends the Blood pressure measurement value to the attribute `RSI_BLE_BLOOD_PRESSURE_MEASUREMENT_UUID` (Ex: 0x2A35) of the remote device and will indicate the GATT client (remote device).
9. `RSI_BLE_BLOOD_PRESSURE_FEATURE_UUID` will describe the value by its fields as shown in fig.

Following are the snapshots of smart phone nRFConnert App act as a client and Silicon Labs device as a server.

**5.3.2** Client

1. Advertise a LE device which supports Blood Pressure Service.
2. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module will connect to that remote device based on given BD address or name.
3. After successful connection Silicon Labs module will read the services from the remote GATT server.
4. If remote device support notify property Silicon Labs module will enable notify, and ready to receive notifications from remote device.
5. Whenever GATT server changes value and notifies that Silicon Labs module will receive that value.
