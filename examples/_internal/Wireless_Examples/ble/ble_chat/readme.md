   ![](resources/readme/load_image1.png)

2. Load the application image

   - Select the board.
   - Browse the application image (.hex) and click on Flash button.

### 5.3 Common Steps

1. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module will be in Advertising state.
2. Open a LE App in the Smartphone and do the scan.
3. In the App, Silicon Labs module device will appear with the name configured in the macro RSI_BLE_APP_SIMPLE_CHAT (Ex: "BLE_SIMPLE_CHAT")or sometimes observed as Silicon Labs device as internal name  "SimpleBLEPeripheral".
4. Initiate connection from the App.
5. After successful connection, LE scanner displays the supported services of Silicon Labs module

6. Select the attribute service which is added RSI_BLE_NEW_SERVICE_UUID
(Ex: 0xAABB)
7. After selecting the service do Write and Read operations with GATT server.
8. Enable notifications for the read attribute RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_2_UUID
(Example: 0x1BB1) So that GATT server notifies when value updated in that particular attribute.
9. Write data (Ex: "Hello World") to attribute RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_1_UUID(Ex: 0x1AA1). So that GATT server notifies when value updated in that particular attribute.

   ![](resources/readme/ble_remote_output2.png)

10. Silicon Labs module receives the data sent by remote device and same data writes into the attribute RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_2_UUID (Ex: 0x1BB1) and will notifies the GATT client (remote device).
