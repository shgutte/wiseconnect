Follow the [Getting Started with Wiseconnect3 SDK](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) guide to set up the hardware connections and Simplicity Studio IDE.

### 2.2 Software Requirements

- [WiSeConnect SDK](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/)

- Embedded Development Environment

- For Silicon Labs EFx32, use the latest version of [Simplicity Studio](https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio)

- Download and install the Silicon Labs [EFR Connect App](https://www.silabs.com/developers/efr-connect-mobile-app) in the android smart phones for testing BLE applications. Users can also use their choice of BLE apps available in Android/iOS smart phones.

## 3. Project Environment

### 3.1 Project Creation

#### 3.1.1 SoC Mode

1. Ensure the SiWx91x setup is connected to your PC.

- In the Simplicity Studio IDE, the SiWx91x SoC board will be detected under **Debug Adapters** pane as shown below.

   ![Soc Board detection](resources/readme/socboarddetection111.png)

- Studio should detect your board. Your board will be shown here. Click on the board detected and go to **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** section.  

- Filter for Bluetooth examples from the Gecko SDK added. For this, check the *Bluetooth* checkbox under **Wireless Technology** and select *BLE - Glucose* application.

   ![project_selection](resources/readme/create_project1.png)

- Click 'Create'. The "New Project Wizard" window appears. Click 'Finish'

  ![creation_final](resources/readme/create_project2.png)

#### 3.1.2 NCP Mode

1. Ensure the EFx32 and SiWx91x setup is connected to your PC.

- In the Simplicity Studio IDE, the EFR32 board will be detected under **Debug Adapters** pane as shown below.

   ![EFR32 Board detection](resources/readme/efr32.png)

- Ensure the latest Gecko SDK along with the WiSeConnect 3 extension is added to Simplicity Studio.

- Go to the 'EXAMPLE PROJECT & DEMOS' tab and select *BLE - Glucose* application.

- Click 'Create'. The "New Project Wizard" window appears. Click 'Finish'.

### 3.2 Setup for Application Prints

#### 3.2.1 SoC Mode

  You can use either of the below USB to UART converters for application prints.

1. Setup using USB to UART converter board.

- Connect Tx (Pin-6) to P27 on WSTK
  - Connect GND (Pin 8 or 10) to GND on WSTK

   **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_1.png)**

2. Setup using USB to UART converter cable.

- Connect RX (Pin 5) of TTL convertor to P27 on WSTK
  - Connect GND (Pin1) of TTL convertor to GND on WSTK

   **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_2.png)**

**Tera Term setup - for NCP and SoC modes**

1. Open the Tera Term tool.

- For SoC mode, choose the serial port to which USB to UART converter is connected and click on **OK**.

   **![UART - SoC](resources/readme/port_selection_soc.png)**

- For NCP mode, choose the J-Link port and click on **OK**.

   **![J-link - NCP](resources/readme/port_selection.png)**

2. Navigate to the Setup â†’ Serial port and update the baud rate to **115200** and click on **OK**.

## 4. Application Configuration Parameters

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

**4.1** Open `app.c` file

**4.1.1** User must update the below parameters

`RSI_BLE_APP_PROXIMITY_REPORTER` refers the name of the RS9116W device to appear during scanning by remote devices.

         #define RSI_BLE_APP_PROXIMITY_REPORTER                   "BLE_PROXIMITY_REPORTER"

Following are the event numbers for advertising, connection and Disconnection events,

         #define RSI_BLE_CONN_EVENT                               0x01
         #define RSI_BLE_DISCONN_EVENT                            0x02
         #define RSI_LINK_LOSS_WRITE_EVENT                        0x03
         #define RSI_BLE_IMME_ALT_WRITE_EVENT                     0x04

2. Open ble_config.h file and update/modify following macros,

         #define RSI_BLE_PWR_INX                                  30 
         #define RSI_BLE_PWR_SAVE_OPTIONS                         BLE_DISABLE_DUTY_CYCLING 

**Note:** ble_config.h file is already set with desired configuration in respective example folders user need not change for each example.
