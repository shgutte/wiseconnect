### 3.2 Setup for Application Prints

#### 3.2.1 SoC Mode

  You can use either of the below USB to UART converters for application prints.

1. Set up using USB to UART converter board.

    - Connect Tx (Pin-6) to P27 on WSTK
    - Connect GND (Pin 8 or 10) to GND on WSTK

    **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_1.png)**

2. Set up using USB to UART converter cable.

    - Connect RX (Pin 5) of TTL convertor to P27 on WSTK
    - Connect GND (Pin1) of TTL convertor to GND on WSTK

    **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_2.png)**

**Tera Term set up - for NCP and SoC modes**

1. Open the Tera Term tool.

    - For SoC mode, choose the serial port to which USB to UART converter is connected and click on **OK**. 

      **![UART - SoC](resources/readme/port_selection_soc.png)**

    - For NCP mode, choose the J-Link port and click on **OK**.

      **![J-link - NCP](resources/readme/port_selection.png)**

2. Navigate to the Setup â†’ Serial port and update the baud rate to **115200** and click on **OK**.

## 4 Application Build Environment

### 4.1 Configure the Application

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

**4.1.1** Open `app.c` file

- User must update the below parameters

`RSI_BLE_LOCAL_NAME` refers the name of the Silicon Labs device to appear during scanning by remote devices.

  ```c
  #define RSI_BLE_LOCAL_NAME                              "BLE_PERIPHERAL"  
  ```

`RSI_SEL_ANTENNA` refers to the antenna which is to be used by Silicon Labs module.  

If the user using internal antenna then set,

  ```c
  #define RSI_SEL_ANTENNA                                 RSI_SEL_INTERNAL_ANTENNA
  ```  

If the user using an external antenna (U.FL connector) then set, RSI_SEL_EXTERNAL_ANTENNA

- Following are the non-configurable macros in the application.
Following are the event numbers for connection and Disconnection events.

  ```c
  #define RSI_APP_EVENT_CONNECTED                         1 
  #define RSI_APP_EVENT_DISCONNECTED                      2
  ```  

**4.1.2** Open ble_config.h file and update/modify following macros

  ```c
  #define RSI_FEATURE_BIT_MAP                             (FEAT_ULP_GPIO_BASED_HANDSHAKE |FEATT_DEV_TO_HOST_ULP_GPIO_1)  
  #define RSI_TCP_IP_BYPASS                               RSI_DISABLE  
  #define RSI_TCP_IP_FEATURE_BIT_MAP                      TCP_IP_FEAT_DHCPV4_CLIENT  
  #define RSI_CUSTOM_FEATURE_BIT_MAP                      FEAT_CUSTOM_FEAT_EXTENTION_VALID  
  #define RSI_EXT_CUSTOM_FEATURE_BIT_MAP                  (EXT_FEAT_LOW_POWER_MODE | EXT_FEAT_XTAL_CLK_ENABLE | EXT_FEAT_384K_MODE)  
  #define RSI_BLE_PWR_INX                                 30  
  #define RSI_BLE_PWR_SAVE_OPTIONS                        BLE_DISABLE_DUTY_CYCLING  
  ```  

**Note:** `ble_config.h` files are already set with desired configuration in respective example folders user need not change for each example.
