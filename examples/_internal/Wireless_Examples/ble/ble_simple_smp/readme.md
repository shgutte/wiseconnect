### 5.3 Common Steps

Following the execution process in case of Silicon Labs device as master

1. If user select the MASTER role, After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs device will be trying to connect to remote BT device, advertise the third party device.
If user select the SLAVE role, After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs device will be advertising, then connect from remote device.
2. After successful connection, flow of commands is as below:
Master device will initiate SMP pairing
Slave device give SMP response.
Both devices will exchange SMP passkey as zero
3. If SMP succeed, host receives SMP encrypt enabled event. If not success, Device sends SMP failure event to host.
4. In encryption enabled event LocalEDIV, Local Rand, LocalLTK parameters will be indicated.
5. Again, after disconnection, if Master want to connect, master ask for LE LTK Request event to slave by giving LocalEDIV and LocalRand, and if same, this example give LocalLTK with positive reply using ltk request reply command.

**Note:**
We can also send negative reply but remote device may or may not initiate pairing again.
Currently, in encryption enabled event EDIV, RAND, LTK are of local device so that if master initiate connection he will ask for LTK request by giving slave's (in this example) EDIV and RAND.
