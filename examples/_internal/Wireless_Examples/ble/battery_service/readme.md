### 5.3 Common Steps

**5.3.1** Server role

1. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module will be in Advertising state.
2. Open a nRFConnect App and do the scan.
3. In the App, Silicon Labs module will appear with the name configured in the macro RSI_BLE_APP_SIMPLE_CHAT (Ex: "BLE_BATTERY_SERVICE") or sometimes observed as Silicon Labs device as internal name "SimpleBLEPeripheral".
4. Initiate connection from the App.
5. After successful connection, nRFConnect displays the supported services of Silicon Labs module.
6. Select the attribute service which is added RSI_BLE_BATTERY_SERVICE_UUID
(Ex: 0x180F).
7. Enable Notify for the characteristic RSI_BLE_BATTERY_LEVEL_UUID
(Ex: 0x2A19). So that GATT server Notifies when value updated in that particular attribute.
8. Silicon Labs module send the Battery Service battery level data to the attribute RSI_BLE_BATTERY_LEVEL_UUID (Ex: 0x2A19) of the remote device and will Notifies the GATT client (remote device).
9. RSI_BLE_CHAR_PRESENTATION_FORMATE_UUID will describe the value by its fields as shown in fig.
10. Please refer the given below image for Notify operation from remote device GATT client.

![Client Characteristic Configuration and Characteristic Presentation Format](resources/readme/image2.png)

**5.3.2** Client role

1. Advertise a LE device which supports Battery Service.
2. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module will connect to that remote device based on given BD address or name
3. After successful connection Silicon Labs module will read the services from the remote GATT server.
4. If remote device support notify property Silicon Labs module will enable notify, and ready to receive notifications from remote device.
5. Whenever GATT server changes value and notifies that Silicon Labs module will receive that value.
