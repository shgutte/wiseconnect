### 5.3 Common Steps

**Server role**

1. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module will be in Advertising state.
2. Open a nRFConnect App and do the scan.
3. In the App, Silicon Labs module will appear with the name configured in the macro `RSI_BLE_APP_GLUCOSE` (Ex: "GLS") or sometimes observed as Silicon Labs device as internal name "SimpleBLEPeripheral" (See Figure 2)
4. Initiate connection from the App.
5. After successful connection, nRFConnect displays the supported services of Silicon Labs module.
6. Select the attribute service which is added `RSI_BLE_GLUCOSE_SERVICE_UUID` (Ex: 0x1808).
7. Enable Notify for the characteristic `RSI_BLE_GLUCOSE_MEASUREMENT_UUID` (Ex: 0x2A18). So that GATT server Notifies when value updated in that particular attribute.
8. Silicon Labs module send the Battery Service battery level data to the attribute `RSI_BLE_GLUCOSE_MEASUREMENT_UUID` (Ex: 0x2A18) of the remote device and will Notifies the GATT client (remote device).
9. `RSI_BLE_GLUCOSE_FEATURE_UUID` will describe the value by its fields as shown in fig.
