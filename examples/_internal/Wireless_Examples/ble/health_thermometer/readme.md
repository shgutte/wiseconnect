   ![](resources/readme/load_image2.png)

### 5.3 Common Steps

1. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module will be in Advertising state.

2. Open a LE App in the Smartphone and do the scan.

3. In the App, Silicon Labs module device will appear with the name configured in the macro RSI_BLE_APP_SIMPLE_CHAT (Ex: "BLE_HEALTH_THERMOMETER") or sometimes observed as Silicon Labs device as internal name "SimpleBLEPeripheral".

4. Initiate connection from the App.

5. After successful connection, LE scanner displays the supported services of Silicon Labs module.

6. Select the attribute service which is added RSI_BLE_HEALTH_THERMOMETER_UUID (Ex: 0x1809).

7. Enable Indicate for the characteristic RSI_BLE_TEMPERATURE_MEASUREMENT_UUID (Ex: 0x2A1C). So that GATT server indicates when value updated in that particular attribute.

8. Silicon Labs module sends the health thermometer temperature measurement data to the attribute RSI_BLE_TEMPERATURE_MEASUREMENT_UUID (Ex: 0x2A1C) of the remote device and indicates the GATT client (remote device).

9. Please refer the given below images for indicate operation from remote device GATT client.
