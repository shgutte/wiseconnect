## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to securely connect a Silicon Labs Si91x Wi-Fi device to AWS IoT Core to send and receive data.

To successfully use this application, developer should be familiar with the operation of [AWS IoT Core](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot.html) and the [AWS IoT Device Shadow Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html). If you are new to AWS IoT Core, we recommend running through the [AWS IoT Core Tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-tutorials.html) before proceeding.
In the following text, 'AWS IoT Core' is referred to as 'AWS' for brevity.

AWS refer 'Device Shadow' as a persistent, virtual representation of a device that can be accessed even if the physical device is offline. The device state is captured in its 'shadow' and is represented as a JSON document. The physical device can send commands using the MQTT protocol to get, update and delete the state of the shadow as well as receive notifications via MQTT about changes in the state of the shadow.

The AWS IoT Device Shadow application publishes temperature and window open/close status on the topic `$aws/things/thingname/shadow/update`.
The room temperature and the window open/close status is available on the AWS cloud.

Additionally, the application subscribes to the shadow update topics:

```sh
  $aws/things/thingName/shadow/name/shadowName/update/accepted
  $aws/things/thingName/shadow/name/shadowName/update/rejected
  $aws/things/thingName/shadow/name/shadowName/update/delta
```

## Overview of AWS SDK

AWS IoT Core is a cloud platform which connects devices across AWS cloud services. AWS IoT provides a interface which allows the devices to communicate securely and reliably in bi-directional ways to the AWS touch-points, even when the devices are offline.

The AWS IoT Device SDK allow applications to securely connect to the AWS IoT platform.

### Configure the application

- Below parameters in **aws_iot_config.h** can be configured based on the AWS domain name, port, client ID and thing name.

  ```c
  #define AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST     "a2m21kovu9tcsh-ats.iot.us-east-2.amazonaws.com" ///< Customer specific MQTT HOST. The same will be used for Thing Shadow
  #define AWS_IOT_MQTT_PORT       8883                ///< default port for MQTT/S
  #define AWS_IOT_MQTT_CLIENT_ID "silicon_labs_thing" ///< MQTT client ID should be unique for every device
  #define AWS_IOT_MY_THING_NAME  "silicon_labs_thing" ///< Thing Name of the Shadow this device is associated with
  ```

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the Wi-Fi - AWS Device Shadow (SOC) or Wi-Fi - AWS Device Shadow (NCP) example in Studio depending on your mode (SoC / NCP).
- Flash, run and debug the application.

After successful execution, the device updates are written to the AWS cloud and they can be observed in the AWS thing shadow.

## Additional Information

- AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST parameter can be found as follows:

  ![AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST_PAGE_1](resources/readme/aws_iot_mqtt_host_url_1.png)

  ![AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST_PAGE_2](resources/readme/aws_iot_mqtt_host_url_2.png)

### Setting up Security Certificates

- To authenticate and securely connect with AWS, your Wi-Fi device requires a unique x.509 security certificate and private key, as well as a CA certificate which is used to verify the AWS server. Security credentials need to be converted into a C-array rather than [PEM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail) provided by AWS; they also need to be added to your project.

- The WiSeConnect3 SDK provides a conversion script (written in Python 3) to make the conversion straightforward. The script is provided in the SDK 'resources' directory and is called [certificate_to_array.py](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/tree/master/resources/certificates/).

- To convert the device certificate and private key to C arrays, open a system command prompt and use the script as indicated in the following examples.

  ```sh
  $> python3 certificate_to_array.py <input filename> <output arrayname>
  ```

  For example:

  ```sh
  $> python3 certificate_to_array.py d8f3a44d3f.cert.pem    aws_client_certificate
  $> python3 certificate_to_array.py d8f3a44d3f.private.key aws_client_private_key
  ```

- After running the script on the certificate and private key, two new files are created.

  ```sh
  aws_client_certificate.pem.crt.h
  aws_client_private_key.pem.key.h
  ```

- Modify the certificate header file names as per the generated file names after running the certificate_to_array.py script in the 'app.c' file.

- Before proceeding, copy both of the new files to the WiSeConnect3 directory: `SimplicityStudio\SDKs\gecko_sdk\extension\wifi-sdk\resources\certificates`  
  Go ahead and overwrite any existing files with the same name in that directory, the originals are not needed.

- The Root CA certificate used by your Wi-Fi device to verify the AWS server is already included in the WiSeConnect3 SDK; no additional setup is required.
  For reference, Amazon uses [Starfield Technologies](https://www.starfieldtech.com/) to secure the AWS website, the WiSeConnect3 SDK includes the [Starfield CA Certificate](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/tree/master/resources/certificates/aws_starfield_ca.pem.h).
    
**Note:**
  > For AWS connectivity, StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate has the highest authority being at the top of the signing hierarchy.
  >
  > The StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate is an expected/required certificate which usually comes pre-installed in the operating systems and plays a key part in certificate chain verification when a device is performing TLS authentication with the IoT endpoint.
  >
  > On SiWx91x device, we do not maintain the root CA trust repository due to memory constraints, so it is mandatory to load Starfield Root CA Class 2 certificate for successful mutual authentication to the AWS server.
  >
  > The certificate chain sent by AWS server is as below:
  > id-at-commonName=Amazon,id-at-organizationalUnitName=Server CA 1B,id-at-organizationName=Amazon,id-at-countryName=US
  > id-at-commonName=Amazon Root CA 1,id-at-organizationName=Amazon,id-at-countryName=US
  > id-at-commonName=Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority ,id-at-organizationName=Starfield Technologies, Inc.,id-at-localityName=Scottsdale,id-at- stateOrProvinceName=Arizona,id-at-countryName=US)
  >  
  > On SiWx91x to authenticate the AWS server, firstly Root CA is validated (validate the Root CA received with the Root CA loaded on the device). Once the Root CA validation is successful, other certificates sent from the AWS server are validated.
  > SiWx91x doesn't authenticate to AWS server if intermediate CA certificates are loaded instead of Starfield Root CA Class 2 certificate and would result in a Handshake error.
  > StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate is at <https://certs.secureserver.net/repository/sf-class2-root.crt>
