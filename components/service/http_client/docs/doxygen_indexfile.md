The SiWx91x™ chipset family runs the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) on its internal network processor and provides the ability for the application processor to exchange data with HTTP servers.

The WiSeConnect™ SDK v3.x provides an application programming interface (API) to access the HTTP features of the device.
