# Introduction

The SiWx91x™ chipset family runs the Simple Network Time Protocol(SNTP) on its internal network processor and provides the ability for the application processor to exchange data with SNTP servers.

The WiSeConnect™ SDK v3.x provides an application programming interface (API) to access the SNTP features of the device.
