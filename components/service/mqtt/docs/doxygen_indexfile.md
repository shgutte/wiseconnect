# Introduction

The SiWx91x™ chipset family runs the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) on its internal network processor and provides the ability for the application processor to connect to an MQTT broker and access MQTT protocol features such as subscribing or publishing to MQTT topics.

The WiSeConnect™ SDK v3.x provides an application programming interface (API) to access the MQTT features of the device.
