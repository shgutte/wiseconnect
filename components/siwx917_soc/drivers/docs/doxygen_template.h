/*! @defgroup SI91X_PERIPHERAL_APIS APIs
 *
 *   This section provides a reference to the Si91x Peripheral API including the functions, data types, and constants provided for various peripherals on the SiWx917â„¢ chipset.
 *
 *  - @ref CALENDAR
 *    functions to set or get the current RTC time and date.
 *  - @ref CONFIG-TIMER
 *    functions to create timers to count clocks and events, capture events on the GPIOs in input mode, and output modulated signals.
 *  - @ref DMA
 *    functions to transfer data from a source peripheral or memory to a destination peripheral or memory over one or more advanced high-performance buses (AHBs).
 *  - @ref MEMLCD
 *    functions to access the liquid crystal display (LCD) peripheral on the device.
 *  - @ref SLEEPTIMER
 *    functions to access software timers, delays, timekeeping, and date features using a low-frequency real-time clock.
 *  - @ref IOSTREAM
 *    functions to perform input/output by creating streams.
 *  - @ref NVM3
 *    functions to access the non-volatile memory (NVM3) driver to maintain key-value pairs in flash memory.
 *  - @ref DISABLE_UC_CONFIG
 *    section providing information on disabling certain peripherals that are enabled by default.
 *  - @ref GPIO
 *    functions to set, clear, and toggle pins, program them as input/output pins, and generate interupts including group interrupts.
 *  - @ref GSPI
 *    functions to access input/output (I/O) interfaces to a wide variety of SPI-compatible peripherals on the device.
 *  - @ref I2C
 *    functions to access the I2C controllers on the device.
 *  - @ref SIO
 *    functions to access the regular GPIO pins and enhanced serial stream processing.
 *  - @ref SSI
 *    functions to access the SSI controllers on the device.
 *  - @ref ULP-TIMER
 *    functions to use low-power timers to count clocks, microseconds, milliseconds, seconds, and minutes with both ref clock and system (SoC) clock.
 *  - @ref USART
 *    functions to access the Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (USART) interfaces on the device.
 *  - @ref WATCHDOG-TIMER
 *    functions to generate interrupts on timeout or a system reset on system failure.
 *  - @ref SENSORHUB
 *    functions to generate sensorhub functionality.
