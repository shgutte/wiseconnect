# Introduction

The SiWx91x™ chipset family provides the ability to download firmware from a server and upgrade it locally on the device. The downloaded firmware image is moved into the executable region of memory and the device is reset to boot it up with the new image.

The WiSeConnect™ SDK v3.x provides an application programming interface (API) to access the firmware upgrade features of the device.
